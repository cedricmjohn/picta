Upload a PDF file to this directory on GitHub before this deadline.

A template Microsoft Word document is including showing a sample title page, and header with link to this repository. You are free to modify this as you wish, or recreate it in alternative software, but must ensure that the same basic information is presented.

You can include any other files here if useful for backup or to create the final PDF file. Appendices may be included as separate PDF documents, but these will not form part of the formal assessment.

Do not edit this README document.
